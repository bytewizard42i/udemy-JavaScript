Welcome friends. This is part of my record keeping for my programming knowledge, that I may be able to present to future employers and relevant others. This is the repo for part of my JavaScript journey. This is my Udemy guided learning course. This teacher is very talented and gives me all the secrets and nuanced materials that you might get in a college environment. I think that this course is super valuable and There is just so much peripheral information that one could spend an incredible amount of time trying to work through alone with youtube videos, which always seem to overlook the details of "How did we get here" during each step.
